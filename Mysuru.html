                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The name Mysuru comes from <i><b>Mahishasura</b></i>; the buffalo demon.
                            There is beautiful story of how Durga is given birth in the form of <i><b>Mahishasura Mardini</b></i>
                            by all the mighty gods of Hindhu Mythology. Mahishasura was granted a wish by Bhrama, the almighty creator,
                            that no man could defeat him in a battle. When the fight commenced between the Lord Indra, the god of war, and the Dev lok
                            against the Asuras, Indra summuned all the gods. But the efforts went futile as Mahishasura could just not be defeated.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para">
                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the guidance of Bhrama, all the gods gave their power to created a fierce feminine entity and give her all their
                            lethal weapons. Her name, she said, was Maha-Lakshmi or Maha-Devi and many other names. She went on a battle with Mahishasura which is said to have lasted
                             for over 10,000 years after which the demon was defeated.   The story depicts the very human nature to quest against the animal nature within him.

                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  There is a statue of Mahishasura at the Mahishasura Circle in Mysuru city, and a Chamundeshwari Temple up the Chamundi Hills depicting
                            that the divine would always stand tall against any force. If you travel around the city, Chamundi Hills is very much
                            visible. You simple don't need a GPS in the city: not to guide to your destination, not even through your life. The city in it's very nature, is, consecrated.
